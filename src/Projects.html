				<h4 class="centerText">1. Computation for an N-Body Particle Simulation using MPI for parallelized computations</h4>
				<button class="collapsible">Open MPI Particle Simulation Description</button>
				<div class="content">
			  		<p>&emsp; For my parallel computing class, I built a program that randomly generates light, medium and heavy particles. The program provides each particle with an initial velocity, a mass and an intial position. This is done in a 3 dimensional plane (x, y, and z plane). The particles interact with each other by evaluating Newton's equations of motion for the forces of all other particles that are acting on each individual particles. Using the matrix of force interactions on each particle and Euler's method, I am able to calculate the next velocity step and the next position step in the sequence. Using command line inputs, the user can choose the amount of all 3 types of particles, the time between steps and the number of steps in the program. After each step, a snapshot is taken of the current position of all particles in 2 dimensions (x and y plane). These pistures are then transferred into a video to show the full particle simulation as shown in the video below. This project was done with Matthew Shortt as a 2 person team. We also added MPI for parallelized computations for greater speedups and efficiency.</p>

				<button class="collapsible">Open Website Description</button>
				<div class="content">
			  		<p>&emsp; I wanted to focus on doing web development. I figured that the techniques and languages utilized in web development would become very useful in the future for job opportunities. This website uses basic web development techniques to summarize my accomplishments, capabilities, and experiences to help a user gain a better perspective of what kind of software engineer I would like to be. I use HTML for the basic website layout. CSS was utilized for customization of each page that is present. Inside the CSS, I use media queries to adjust the elements that exist on the page for a better arrangement and simple user interface. I also utilize JavaScript to add animations and user interactions to made the webpage more user friendly.</p>

				<button class="collapsible">Open Amazon Alexa Project Description</button>
				<div class="content">
			  		<p>&emsp; In January 2018, I was given an excellent opportunity to attend DeltaHacks 4 which was hosted at McMaster University. This provided me an excellent opportunity to build connections for companies in the industry and utilize software components that I do not always have access to. The hackathon ran for a 24 hour period in which I got to work with two other students to learn how to build Amazon Alexa commands. We also worked together with StdLib to utilize some of their libraries for improved customization and functional capabilities. In the day, we coded a basic amazon echo command that could send text messages to your contacts utilizing some basic speech commands. The content of the text message and the person you wish to message were both included in the amazon command to allow a wide range of messages. We were also planning on making abbreviated forms to send common text messages but we ran out of time. </p>

				<button class="collapsible">Open Password Generator Description</button>
				<div class="content">
			  		<p>&emsp; This project consists of a chrome extension that can be used to provide the user with a safe unique password for each website that they have a login for. It uses a combination of a salt file that is unique to the user, a user key, and the current domain name to generate the user a safe and secure password. The password is not stored anywhere meaning that it cannot be hacked. The output is hashed using SHA-256 to increase the difficulty of the password. Current market solutions involde password managers (storing passwords) and password generators (easier passwords to crack). This project was designed to incorporate the best solutions of both and add additional security for safe password protection. There is also a preferences page to choose certain characteristics that the user may want to see in a password.</p>

				<button class="collapsible">Open Music Recommendation App Description</button>
				<div class="content">
			  		<p>&emsp; The goal of this project was to utilize a very large dataset and base the application off of what data was present in the dataset. Our group chose to do a million song dataset with a Java/Python implementation. We allowed the user to listen to a portion of a song. The user proceeded to answer a series of questions about what they liked and disliked about the song. Using those answers we compared the values to the data in the dataset to select another song that the user may prefer. We asked questions about tempo, artists, loudness, genre, and a few more. Comparing the results we were able to narrow down songs that the user may prefer to help them find new songs to add to their ipods/phones.</p>

				<div class="content">
			  		<p>&emsp; This Java application was designed to allow the user to navigate the system using commands in the command line for finding items that they wish to purchase. Users have logins and each user is able to add items to their shopping cart. These items can then be purchased. As items were bought/returned, the stock available was updated accordingly. Records for previous purchases are stored.</p>
