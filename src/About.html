		<p class="movefromright">My name is Phillip Pavlich. You can call me "Phil" for short. I am a third year software engineering and management student at McMaster University. Management opens up my field to also learn about business, finance and accounting. In first year at Mac, I took a beginner course to programming in Python. Ever since, I have had a passion for software and I want to take every chance I get to expand my knowledge by making a difference for a company or a client. </p>

		<p class="movefromright">Outside of school, I have put aside time to develop my programming skills and code for fun. I have a lot of experience coding in Java. I have used Code Academy to learn several languages such as Javascript, html, css, jquery and C++. Through work expereriences, I have been able to work heavily in database programming and C#. I have done reporting processes including SSIS and SSRS.</p> 

		<p class="movefromright">I am looking to join a hackathon in the near future so if you are interested in doing the same message me and we can make a group.</p> 

		<p class="movefromright">I’m always interested in hearing from former colleagues, managers, or just interesting creative folk, so feel free to contact me if you’d like to connect. You can contact me at:
		pavlichphillip@yahoo.ca or
		pavlicpm@mcmaster.ca </p>
