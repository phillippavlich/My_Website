		<p class="col-xs-6 firstPara"> &emsp; My name is Phillip Pavlich. You can call me "Phil" for short. I am a fourth year software engineering and management student at McMaster University. Management provides me with the opportunity to learn valuable business concepts such as finance, economics and accounting. In my first year at Mac, I took a beginner programming course in Python. Ever since, I have had a passion for software development and I want to take advantage of every chance I get to expand my knowledge by making a difference in my community. </p>

		<p class="col-xs-6 AllPara"> &emsp; Outside of school, I have put aside time to develop my programming skills and code for fun. I have a lot of experience coding in Java. I have used Code Academy to learn several languages such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, JQuery and C++. Through work experiences, I have been able to work heavily in SQL and C#. I have done a lot of work managing a database, performing investigations to solve system bugs and using reporting processes including SSIS and SSRS.</p> 

		<p class="col-xs-3 AllPara NextLine"> &emsp; Outside of school and work, I am a 22 year old born and raised in Whitby, Ontario. I grew up playing many different sports including hockey, baseball, lacrosse and football. Hockey is my favorite as I started from a young child. I have played competitively up until the AAA. My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p>

		<p class="col-xs-5 AllPara clearLeft"> &emsp; At home, I have 2 dogs. One is a golden retriever named Dexter. The other is a border collie named Marty. Dogs are truly mans best friend! I come from a family of five. I am the oldest of 3 brothers. My hometown is Whitby, Ontario. In my free time over the summers, I love going up to the cottage. Cottage life is a great way to relax and enjoy the great weather.</p>
