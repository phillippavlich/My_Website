			<p class="movefromleft">&emsp; I am currently employed at NexgenRx as a Junior Technical Analyst in the IT department. Nexgen RX is a pharmaceutical company that specializes in the adjudication process of client drug, dental and extended health care benefits. I have dealt a great deal with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). I worked with developing and testing stored procedures while maintaining data integrity in our databases. Using available claims data, I have developed reports to match many different client requests. I perform daily tasks so that I can troubleshoot any errors in our daily operations to ensure that all claims entering our system are following the specified requirements. I have coded projects in Visual Basic 6 and Visual Studios(C# and vb.net) in order to automate reports and to build applications for multiple purposes.</p>

			<p class="movefromleft"> &emsp; NexgenRx has taught me a great deal about working with other programmers and feeding off of each other's ideas. They have improved my ability to follow the software design process and to ensure that each piece of code is quality tested with a rollback option available for if we ever need to return to a previous version. Finally, I have learned a lot about project management. I always have multiple projects on my to do list with different priorities and different deadlines. I have had much experience in managing these projects in a clear and efficient manner to produce high quality work for our clients.</p>
